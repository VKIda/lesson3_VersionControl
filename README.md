# Project Name: Lesson 3 Version Control

## Course Title: 
LIS 2360: Web Application Development

## Assignment Date:
Febuary 6, 2017

## Student Name:
Valerie Ida

## Project Description:
Lesson 3 assignment is focused on Version Control. It explains the importance of it, the various different version control systems, and why GIT is an exceptional VCS to work with.

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. Version control allows you to revert to a previous “version”, but it can also be applied to website pages, Photoshop images, and more. Not only does it allow you to revert to previous save points it also allows the user to compare the updated and the previous saved file. 
2. Git thinks of their files like snapshots, if the user wanted to upload a changed file, Git would look at all the files and store a reference to that snapshot. Better yet, if nothing in the file has changed, Git will not update and file, and instead just link to the previous identical file.
3. If you’re on the go, or somewhere with no internet access, you would still be able to access any file because it is right there on your machine. When you are done editing the file and save it, when you regain internet access, the file will then be uploaded to Git.
