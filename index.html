            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is very important when dealing with almost anything computer related that is being constantly updated. Version control allows you to revert to a previous “version”, but it can also be applied to website pages, Photoshop images, and more. Not only does it allow you to revert to previous save points it also allows the user to compare the updated and the previous saved file. It will also allow the user to see whom, if not yourself, updated the file. Version control is a must as many things can happen while working on projects, such a serious crash or a corrupt file. You will need a way to access your previous working file.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">What happens if you have more than one person working on a single project? Chances are that you will likely make alterations to the file that someone may have already done differently or they may have made a big change in the file. This is where Centralized Version Control Systems comes into play. This allows the two users to both have access to the most recently updated file. Not only do they have access, they can see when it was last updated and who did it. Once the file is saved by a user, it is automatically uploaded to the central server, and that file version is accessible to all other users. The downside to this is that the file is not saved to every computer, so if the central server were to go down, then no one would have access to that file. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">History of GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git originally began when linux kernel was an open source project. Originally, during the project the changes and updates were passed around as they were made. But, in 2002 they started using a DVCS called BitKeeper. However, eventually BitKeeper shutdown. So the people working on the project created their own tool, and listed a few things as a necessity. Them being; Speed, Simple design, Strong support for non-linear development, fully distributed, and able to handle large projects. This is what started Git in 2005, and has much grown since then, but has kept its core ideas. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">How Git Works</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many differences with the way Git and other Version Control systems store their data. Other Version Control Systems have a base file and from there they keep a record of what about the file has changed over time. Git, on the other hand, doesn’t do it this way. Git thinks of their files like snapshots, if the user wanted to upload a changed file, Git would look at all the files and store a reference to that snapshot. Better yet, if nothing in the file has changed, Git will not update and file, and instead just link to the previous identical file. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Git Benefits</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is local! This is great in terms of latency as being able to access your files almost instantaneously is a huge plus when you think about how often you have to access these files. If you’re on the go, or somewhere with no internet access, you would still be able to access any file because it is right there on your machine. When you are done editing the file and save it, when you regain internet access, the file will then be uploaded to Git. Of course this was a bit bigger when it first came out and internet access was limited, but this is still a huge plus.  </p>
